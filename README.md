## Project Report

* Extract: 
    * Extracted data from the CMS for Cancer stats and CDC for Home Health stats by state
    * All data sets were extracted by using .read_csv and referencing the download link

* Transform: 
    * We merged the cancer stats into one data frame
    * The home health stats were kept separate as we thought this would be a cleaner way to view the data.  While they all have a one to one         relationship (all of the stats are by state).  We thought the concepts are better laid out separately
    * We only kept two data points from the home health stats that seemed relevant
    * To be consistent and concise we renamed the columns for all the data points
